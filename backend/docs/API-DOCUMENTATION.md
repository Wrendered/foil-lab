# Foil Lab API Documentation

## Overview

The Foil Lab API provides REST endpoints for analyzing wingfoil/sailing GPS tracks. Built with FastAPI, it exposes the core analysis algorithms for use by any frontend application.

**Base URL**: `https://strava-tracks-analyzer-production.up.railway.app`

## Authentication

Currently, the API is open and does not require authentication. This may change in future versions.

## Endpoints

Check if the API service is running and healthy.

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/health`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "foil-lab-api"

---

## Error Handling

All endpoints return standard HTTP status codes and JSON error responses:

```json
{
  "detail": "Error message describing what went wrong"
}
```

Common error scenarios:
- Invalid GPX file format
- Empty or corrupted file
- Invalid parameter values
- Server processing errors

---

## Rate Limiting

Currently, there are no rate limits implemented. This may change based on usage patterns.

---

## CORS Configuration

The API is configured to accept requests from any origin (`*`) to support frontend development. In production, this should be restricted to specific domains.

---

## Data Processing Notes

### Wind Direction
- Wind direction represents where the wind is coming FROM
- 0° = North, 90° = East, 180° = South, 270° = West
- The algorithm uses an iterative refinement process

### Segment Detection
- Segments are detected based on consistent bearing/heading
- Adaptive parameters scale with track duration for long sessions
- Short segments below thresholds are filtered out

### Performance Calculations
- VMG (Velocity Made Good) uses distance-weighted averaging
- Upwind angles are measured relative to estimated wind direction
- Best angles represent optimal performance achieved

---

## Integration Examples

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```typescript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', gpxFile);

const response = await fetch(
  'https://api.example.com/api/analyze-track?wind_direction=270',
  {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  }
);

const result = await response.json();
```

### Python
```python
import requests

files = {'file': open('track.gpx', 'rb')}
params = {
    'wind_direction': 270,
    'min_duration': 10
}

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.example.com/api/analyze-track',
    files=files,
    params=params
)

result = response.json()
```

## Webhook Support

Webhooks are not currently supported but may be added for long-running analysis tasks in the future.

---

## Versioning

The API currently does not use versioning. Breaking changes will be communicated in advance.
